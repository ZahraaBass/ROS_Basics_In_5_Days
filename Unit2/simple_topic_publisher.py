# This previous line  should be at the very first line of your node, and will make sure that your scripts run inside the virtual environment, just copy and paste it at the beginining of each node using python.)


# Import the necessary libraries, here we need:
# rospy: a python library used to quickly interface with ROS Topics, Services, and Parameters.
# Twist from geometry_msgs: This allows to provide messages for common geometric primitives such as points, vectors, and poses.
import rospy 
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

# Initialize the node called: topic_publisher
rospy.init_node('topic_publisher')

# Create a Publisher that will publish (Send Messages) to a topic called "/cmd_vel". The Messages published are of type "Twist". 
# queue_size is the size of the outgoing message queue used for asynchronous publishing (1 is good for this case, read here for more http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers)
pub = rospy.Publisher('/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=1)

# Create a Rate Object, meaning we set a publish rate to 2 Hz. i.e. when rate.sleep() is called, the msg will be sent 2 times per second.
rate = rospy.Rate(2)

# Create an instant of the Msg Twist called move (or just anything), so we can use it later:
move = Twist()

# Send Command velocity messages through the instant move we just made.
move.linear.x = 0.5
move.angular.z = 0.5

# As longs as the Control+C is not pressed:
while not rospy.is_shutdown():  
    # Publish the message:
    pub.publish(move) 
    # the msg will be published at a rate of 2x per second.
    rate.sleep()
